# FamFlow

FamFlow is an open source family planner focused on everyday household coordination.
It combines shared task management, calendar visibility, and shopping planning in one place, while keeping room for private individual calendars.

## Vision

Families need a practical planner that is simple enough for daily use and flexible enough for real routines. FamFlow is being built to support:

- Shared todo lists for the whole family.
- One-time tasks and recurring tasks (for example, taking out the trash every week).
- Task assignment to family members.
- Shared family calendars, including sync from subscribed private calendars (for example Google Calendar subscriptions).
- Shared shopping lists.

## Current Project Status

This project is in an early foundation phase.

- Backend: basic server and route scaffolding is present.
- Frontend: initial Flutter app scaffold is present.
- Feature completeness for planner functionality: approximately 5-10%.
